# Results of task 1.1
As a consequence of carrying out the **task 1.1**, a webpage has been created using *HTML* and *CSS*. 
As far as I’m concerned, this task was an imitation of webpage development process by two developers (it could also be just one person). For obvious reasons, *“develop"* branch was created. 
For instance, first user was working on adding images :framed_picture:, whereas second one was working on editing style :art: of webpage. As a result, branches of these users were merged back into *“develop”* branch and then back into *“main”* branch to deploy to production.

# What is DevOps? 
Before the existence of **DevOps**, the process of releasing product was at a snail’s pace :snail:. It brought about creation of DevOps philosophy. It uses practices to automate this process such as CI/CD. Consequently, it leads to frequent but small updates and smooth communication between developers and operations teems.
